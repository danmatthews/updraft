# UpDraft
A quick starter project for quickly prototyping ideas with TailwindCSS - mainly for quickly setting up my own projects, but feel free to take away and adjust for your own needs.

- Download
- Remove the `.git` folder if you've cloned in git.
- Run `npm install`
- Make sure you've got `gulp` installed globally - `npm -i -g gulp gulp-cli`
- Run `gulp styles`
- Open `index.html`

Enjoy.
